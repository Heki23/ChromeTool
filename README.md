<h1>Chrome profile recovery tool</h1>
<p>This is my internship project. With my tool you can restore your Chrome profile without many clicks. You can easily transfer the computer a profile to computer b. My software will restore your team and the pinned link. In 2023 the profile picture too but in 2024 Chrome updated their file and now the profile picture no longer works and you should also provide an email address but in 2023 you shouldn't do that</p>
